# Getting Started

## Installing R Packages

The code below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)

```

## Importing Data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
show_col_types = FALSE
head(exam_data, n = 5)

```

# What is ggplot2?

Applied to visualizations, **grammar of graphics** is a grammar used to describe and create a wide range of statistical graphics. This layered approach is implemented in **ggplot2**, an R package for creating data-driven graphics. It has become the go-to tool for making plots flexibly in R.

-   **Data**: The dataset being plotted.

-   **Aesthetics** take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.

-   **Geometrics**: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.

-   **Facets** split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).

-   **Statistics**, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g.Â mean, confidence intervals).

-   **Coordinate systems** define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.

-   **Themes** modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.

# **Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2**

Let's examine the first three essential layers for making a plot - Data, Aesthetics and Geometries.

## **Data**

First, let's call the ggplot() function using the below code.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data)
```

## Aesthetic mappings

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS))
```

## Geom

# Plotting a Bar Chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data,
       aes(x = RACE)) + 
  geom_bar()

```
