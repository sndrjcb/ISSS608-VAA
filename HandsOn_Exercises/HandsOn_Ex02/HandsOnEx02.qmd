There are several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. Let's explore these features!

# Getting Started

Besides tidyverse, four R packages will be used.

-   ggrepel: to provide geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels

-   ggthemes: to provide extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’

-   hrbrthemes: for typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2

-   patchwork: for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2

To check if these packages have been installed and to load them into your working R environment, run the below code.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, tidyverse)
```
