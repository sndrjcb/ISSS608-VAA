# 5.1 Learning Outcome

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to model, analyse and visualise network data using R.

By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

-   create graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of *dplyr*, *lubridate*, and *tidygraph*,

-   build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of *ggraph*,

-   compute network geometrics using *tidygraph*,

-   build advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and

-   build interactive network visualisation using *visNetwork* package.

# 5.2 Getting Started

## 5.2.1 Installing and **launching R packages**

In this hands-on exercise, four network data modelling and visualisation packages will be installed and launched. They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse andÂ [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, 
               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,
               tidyverse, graphlayouts, 
               concaveman, ggforce)
```
